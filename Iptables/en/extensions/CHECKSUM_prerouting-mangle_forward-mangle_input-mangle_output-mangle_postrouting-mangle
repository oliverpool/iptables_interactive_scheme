This target allows to selectively work around broken/old applications. It can only be used in the mangle table.<br><br>
<strong>--checksum-fill </strong> -  Compute and fill in the checksum in a packet that lacks a checksum. <br><br>

that do not work well with checksum offloads, but don't want to disable checksum offload in your device.
