TOS
This module sets the Type of Service field in the IPv4 header (including the "precedence" bits) or 
the Priority field in the IPv6 header. Note that TOS shares the same bits as DSCP and ECN. 
The TOS target is only valid in the mangle table.
--set-tos value[/mask]
Zeroes out the bits given by mask (see NOTE below) and XORs value into the TOS/Priority field. 
If mask is omitted, 0xFF is assumed.
--set-tos symbol
You can specify a symbolic name when using the TOS target for IPv4. 
It implies a mask of 0xFF (see NOTE below). The list of recognized TOS names can be obtained by calling iptables with -j TOS -h.
The following mnemonics are available:

--and-tos bits
Binary AND the TOS value with bits. (Mnemonic for --set-tos 0/invbits, where invbits is the binary negation of bits. See NOTE below.)
--or-tos bits
Binary OR the TOS value with bits. (Mnemonic for --set-tos bits/bits. See NOTE below.)
--xor-tos bits
Binary XOR the TOS value with bits. (Mnemonic for --set-tos bits/0. See NOTE below.)
NOTE: In Linux kernels up to and including 2.6.38, with the exception of longterm releases 2.6.32 (>=.42), 2.6.33 (>=.15), and 2.6.35 (>=.14), 
there is a bug whereby IPv6 TOS mangling does not behave as documented and differs from the IPv4 version. 
The TOS mask indicates the bits one wants to zero out, so it needs to be inverted 
before applying it to the original TOS field. However, the aformentioned kernels 
forgo the inversion which breaks --set-tos and its mnemonics.
