REJECT (IPv6-specific)
This is used to send back an error packet in response to the matched packet: otherwise it is equivalent to DROP 
so it is a terminating TARGET, ending rule traversal. This target is only valid in the INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT chains, 
and user-defined chains which are only called from those chains. The following option controls the nature of the error packet returned:
--reject-with type
The type given can be icmp6-no-route, no-route, icmp6-adm-prohibited, 
adm-prohibited, icmp6-addr-unreachable, addr-unreach, or icmp6-port-unreachable, 
which return the appropriate ICMPv6 error message (icmp6-port-unreachable is the default).
Finally, the option tcp-reset can be used on rules which only 
match the TCP protocol: this causes a TCP RST packet to be sent back. This is mainly useful for 
blocking ident (113/tcp) probes which frequently occur when sending mail to broken mail hosts 
(which won't accept your mail otherwise). tcp-reset can only be used with kernel versions 2.6.14 or later.
