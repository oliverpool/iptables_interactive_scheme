This target allows you to statically map a whole network of addresses onto another network of addresses. 
It can only be used from rules in the nat table.
<ul><strong>--to address[/mask]</strong> - Network address to map to. 
The resulting address will be constructed in the following way: All 'one' bits in the mask are 
filled in from the new `address'. All bits that are zero in the mask are filled in from the original address.</ul>
IPv6 support available since Linux kernels >= 3.7.
