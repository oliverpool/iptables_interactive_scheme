REJECT (IPv4-specific)
This is used to send back an error packet in response to the matched packet: otherwise it is equivalent to DROP so 
it is a terminating TARGET, ending rule traversal. This target is only valid in the INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT chains, 
and user-defined chains which are only called from those chains. The following option controls the nature of the error packet returned:
--reject-with type
The type given can be icmp-net-unreachable, icmp-host-unreachable, icmp-port-unreachable, icmp-proto-unreachable, 
icmp-net-prohibited, icmp-host-prohibited, or icmp-admin-prohibited (*), which return the appropriate ICMP error message 
(icmp-port-unreachable is the default). The option tcp-reset can be used on rules which only match the TCP protocol: 
this causes a TCP RST packet to be sent back. This is mainly useful for blocking ident (113/tcp) probes which frequently 
occur when sending mail to broken mail hosts (which won't accept your mail otherwise).
(*) Using icmp-admin-prohibited with kernels that do not support it will result in a plain DROP instead of REJECT
