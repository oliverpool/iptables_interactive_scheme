This target is only valid in the nat table, in the POSTROUTING chain. 
It should only be used with dynamically assigned IP (dialup) connections: if you have a static IP address, 
you should use the SNAT target. Masquerading is equivalent to specifying a mapping to the IP address of 
the interface the packet is going out, but also has the effect that connections are forgotten when 
the interface goes down. This is the correct behavior when the next dialup is unlikely to have the same interface address 
(and hence any established connections are lost anyway).
<ul><strong>--to-ports port[-port] </strong> - 
This specifies a range of source ports to use, overriding the default SNAT source 
port-selection heuristics (see above). This is only valid if the rule also specifies 
one of the following protocols: tcp, udp, dccp or sctp.</ul>
<ul><strong>--random </strong> - Randomize source port mapping If option --random is used 
then port mapping will be randomized (kernel >= 2.6.21). Since kernel 5.0, --random is identical to --random-fully.</ul>
<ul><strong>--random-fully  </strong> - Full randomize source port mapping If option 
--random-fully is used then port mapping will be fully randomized (kernel >= 3.13).</ul>
IPv6 support available since Linux kernels >= 3.7.
