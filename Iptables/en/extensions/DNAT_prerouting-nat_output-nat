This target is only valid in the <strong>nat</strong> table, in the <strong>PREROUTING</strong> and <strong>OUTPUT</strong> chains,
and user-defined chains which are only called from those chains. It specifies that the destination 
address of the packet should be modified (and all future packets in this connection will also be mangled), 
and rules should cease being examined. It takes the following options:
<ul><strong>--to-destination [ipaddr[-ipaddr]][:port[-port]]</strong> - which can specify a single new 
destination IP address, an inclusive range of IP addresses. Optionally a port range, if the rule 
also specifies one of the following protocols: tcp, udp, dccp or sctp. If no port range is specified,
 then the destination port will never be modified. If no IP address is specified then only the destination port 
will be modified. In Kernels up to 2.6.10 you can add several --to-destination options. 
For those kernels, if you specify more than one destination address, either via an address range or 
multiple <strong> --to-destination </strong> options, a simple round-robin (one after another in cycle) 
load balancing takes place between these addresses. Later Kernels (>= 2.6.11-rc1) don't have the ability to NAT to multiple ranges anymore.</ul>
<ul><strong>--random</strong> - If option --random is used then port mapping will be randomized (kernel >= 2.6.22).</ul>
<ul><strong>--persistent </strong> - Gives a client the same source-/destination-address for each connection. 
This supersedes the SAME target. Support for persistent mappings is available from 2.6.29-rc2.
IPv6 support available since Linux kernels >= 3.7. </ul>
