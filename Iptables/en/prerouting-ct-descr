It uses <strong>conntrack</strong>, a netfilter component that provides connection status tracking and
packet classification in terms of connection membership, which allows netfilter to perform full-fledged stateful traffic filtering. 
Like netfilter, the conntrack system is part of the Linux kernel. <br><br>

Tasks:<br>
<ul>Tracking the states of individual connections in order to classify each packet either as belonging to
an already established connection or as opening a new connection. At the same time, the concept of "connection state" is artificially introduced 
for protocols in which it is initially absent (UDP, ICMP). When working with protocols
that support states (for example, TCP), conntrack actively uses this feature, closely interacting with the basic network subsystem of the Linux kernel.</ul>

<ul>Tracking of related connections, for example, ICMP responses to TCP and UDP packets. A more complex option is protocols that use multiple
connections in one session, for example, FTP. For proper processing of such protocols, conntrack uses special modules (conntrack helpers), 
which analyze traffic and "snatch" protocol information about new connections (for example, the port to which it will be opened),
which allows them to be correctly filtered, routed, shaped and passed through NAT.</ul>

<br> To interact with the conntrack system from userspace, the conntrack-tools kit has been developed, containing two utilities:

<ul><strong>conntrack</strong> — a tool that allows the system administrator to observe the connection status tables and 
interact with them: clear tables entirely, delete individual records, mark connections manually (analogous to the CONNMARK action),
set connection timeouts. Output filtering is supported (for example, based on source and/or destination addresses and/or ports),
as well as output in various formats, including XML. In addition, this utility allows you to monitor
conntrack system events in real time, for example, opening new connections or changing the status of existing ones.</ul>

<ul><strong>conntrackd</strong> is a daemon that provides synchronization of state tables with other hosts, which in combination
with the capabilities of the keepalived daemon allows you to create firewalls on high Availability clusters — if
one of the cluster hosts fails, its connections will be "picked up" by other cluster hosts and correctly processed taking into account the states. 
conntrackd can also be used simply to remotely collect statistics on connections.</ul>
