The <strong>nat</strong> table in the <strong>PREROUTING</strong> chain - packets get into this chain before making a routing decision.<br><br>

In fact, the term "routing decision" implies dividing traffic into incoming (intended for the host itself) and
transit (going through this host to other hosts). It is at this stage that it is necessary to perform forwarding operations (DNAT, REDIRECT, NETMAP). 

Available actions:<br>

<ul><strong>DNAT</strong> (Destination NAT) - This action allows you to change the destination address or port of the packet when it passes 
through the PREROUTING chain. As a result, the packet will be redirected to another destination address and/or port. 
For example, you can use DNAT to redirect incoming network traffic to another server or port.<br>
Example of using DNAT:<br><br>
<pre> iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.100:8080 </pre></ul>

<ul><strong>REDIRECT</strong> - This action allows you to redirect packets to local ports on the same host, 
where the packet passes through the PREROUTING chain. This is useful when configuring proxy servers or port forwarding at the local level.<br> 

Example of using REDIRECT:<br><br> 
<pre> iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j REDIRECT --to-port 80 </pre></ul>

<ul><strong>NETMAP</strong> is an additional extension of iptables that allows you to change the IP addresses of packets for
networks using special cards. This will be useful, for example, when redirecting packets between different private networks.<br>

Example of using NETMAP:<br><br> 
<pre> iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 192.168.0.0/24 -j NETMAP --to 172.16.0.0/24 </pre></ul>
