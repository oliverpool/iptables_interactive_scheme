Table <strong>nat</strong> in the chain <strong>POSTROUTING</strong><br><br>
Available actions:<br>

<ul><strong>SNAT</strong> (Source NAT) - This action allows you to change the address or port of the packet source when
it passes through the POSTROUTING chain. It is used to change the source address of the packet and/or the port
of the source connection. SNAT is often used to change outgoing traffic from a private address space to a public public address
in order to achieve internet accessibility.<br>

Example of using SNAT:<br><br>
</pre> iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j SNAT --to-source 203.0.113.10 </pre></ul>

<ul><strong> MASQUERADE</strong> - This action is a special form of SNAT and is used to dynamically change the source
address of packets when the sources are dynamic IP addresses (for example, configured via DHCP). MASQUERADE is convenient to use
in cases when the external address of the nat server is unknown in advance.<br>

Example of using MASQUERADE:<br><br>
<pre> iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j MASQUERADE </pre></ul>

<ul><strong>NETMAP</strong> - As in the PREROUTING chain, the NETMAP action allows you to change the IP addresses of packets
for networks using special cards, but after passing through the POSTROUTING chain.<br>

Example of using NETMAP:<br><br>
<pre> iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -d 172.16.0.0/24 -j NETMAP --to 192.168.0.0/24 </pre></ul>
